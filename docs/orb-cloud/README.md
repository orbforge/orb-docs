# Orb Cloud

Orb is an internet experience platform that uses continuous data collection from run-anywhere sensors (Orbs) to deliver comprehensive insight into any device’s connectivity. It focuses on three key pillars: Responsiveness, Reliability, and Speed. These pillars form the basis of a 0-100 Orb Score that can be easily understood by any internet user. The Orb Score—along with its component scores and the underlying metrics—is stored on-device for local or remote access.

Orb Cloud, accessible at [https://cloud.orb.net](https://cloud.orb.net), allows you to

* View the [Status](/docs/orb-cloud/status) of your Orbs and manage them
* [Orchestrate](/docs/deploy-and-configure) your Orbs with advanced deployment and configuration options

:::info
To use the latest Orb Cloud features, Orb app and sensor versions 1.3 and above are required.
