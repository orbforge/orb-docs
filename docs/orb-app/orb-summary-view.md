# Orb Summary View

The Orb summary view is the main dashboard of the app, providing a quick overview of network performance across your various devices with Orb installed. This guide explains how to interpret the information displayed and how to use this screen effectively.

## Common Elements

At the top of the screen, you'll find a time selector that allows you to choose the time range for the data displayed. Options include:

- Last 1 minute
- Last 5 minutes
- Last 1 hour
- Last 24 hours

### Orb Scores, Network Information, and Status

All Orbs on the summary view display the Orb Score, status (online, offline), network name, connection information (WiFi, Wired, Cellular), and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Mobile Operator Network (MNO) information (if available).

## Orb Summary Layout

When you open the Orb app, the summary view is the first screen you'll see. It's divided into several key sections:

### This Orb

In the upper-left corner of the screen, you’ll see a section labeled "This Orb". It shows the Orb that’s installed on the device you’re currently using.

Some information may not be available if you haven't granted the app the necessary permissions.

Tap on this Orb to see more detailed information about this device and connection.

### Favorite Orbs

This section lists the Orbs you've marked as favorites. These are Orbs that you frequently monitor or want quick access to.
