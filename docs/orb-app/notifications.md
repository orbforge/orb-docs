# Orb Notifications

This guide explains how to configure and customize notifications in the Orb app so you can stay informed about your network's performance and any issues that arise.

## Types of Notifications

Orb can send notifications to keep you informed about your network:

### Offline/Online Status Notifications

**Sensor Status**: Alerts about your Orb sensors going offline or coming back online.

## Notification Settings

### Accessing Notification Settings from Account Settings

1. Open the Orb app.
2. Go to Settings > Notifications.
3. You'll see a list of notifications available for your account.

   - Allow Notifications: Toggling this allows the device to receive notifications from your Orbs.
   - Orb list: All Orbs linked to your account appear below; specify which Orbs you would like to receive notifications from.

   Note: Receiving notifications from mobile devices may be too noisy as these Orbs will go online and offline frequently (when the app is closed or backgrounded). Exceptions include using a spare phone as a dedicated sensor or using the "keep awake" feature.
4. Set your preference for the sensitivity of your notifications by using the dropdown menu with the following options:
   - Instant: Receive notifications immediately when an Orb goes offline or comes back online.
   - 10 seconds: Default setting, receive notifications after 10 seconds of being offline.
   - 1 minute: Receive notifications after 1 minute of being offline.
   - 5 minutes: Receive notifications after 5 minutes of being offline.
   - 10 minutes: Receive notifications after 15 minutes of being offline.
