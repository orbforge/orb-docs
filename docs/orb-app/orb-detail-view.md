# Orb Detail View

The Orb detail view provides in-depth information about your network connectivity. This guide explains how to navigate and interpret the detailed metrics screens.

## Accessing the Detail View

You can access detailed metrics by tapping on any Orb card in the Orb Summary screen to open the detail view for that specific Orb.

## Common Elements

All detail views share certain common elements:

### Time Period Selector

At the top of each detail view, you'll find a time period selector that allows you to view data across different time periods, including:

- Last 1 minute
- Last 5 minutes
- Last 1 hour
- Last 24 hours

There are indicators within the Orb Score that represent Responsiveness, Reliability, and Speed. When illuminated, these indicate which scores are contributing to the overall Orb Score.
