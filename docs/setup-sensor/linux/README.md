# Install the Orb Sensor on Linux

## Installation

Orb is packaged and ready to go for a number of mainstream Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Raspberry Pi OS, Arch, Alpine, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora Linux, openSUSE, Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux, and more. For most instances, you can install Orb with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.orb.net/install.sh | sh
```

On supported platforms, the installation will provide a prompt (y/n) asking if you would like to enable automated updates to keep Orb up to date. We recommend enabling automated updates.
