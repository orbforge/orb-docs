# Using an Spare Android Device as a Standalone Orb

## Introduction

That spare Android phone or tablet sitting in a drawer gathering dust can find new purpose as a dedicated Orb sensor! By repurposing your unused device, you can continuously monitor your network health without purchasing additional hardware. This guide will walk you through the simple process of setting up your Android device as a standalone Orb.

## Equipment Needed

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An extra Android device running Android 10 or above
- A power adapter for your device
- Optional: a USB-C to Ethernet adapter (if you want to test wired connections)

## Step 1: Install Orb

1. Connect the Android device to your WiFi network
2. On the device, open the Google Play Store
3. Search for "Orb" or visit [Orb - Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.orb.orb)
4. Tap "Install" and wait for the installation to complete
5. Once installed, open the Orb app

## Step 2: Link the New Orb to Your Orb Account

You have two options to link this device to your Orb account:

**Option 1: Log in directly on the device**

1. When you open the Orb app for the first time, you'll be presented with onboarding screens and permission requests
2. Sign in or create an account if you don't have one during onboarding (recommended)
3. Configure your Orb device by following the on-screen instructions

**Option 2: Link from another device**

1. Open the Orb app on your primary device (phone or computer) that's already logged into your account
2. Navigate to "Orbs on this network" in the Orb Summary
3. Your new Orb device should appear in the list of available devices
4. Tap on the device menu and select "Link to my account"

## Step 3: Keep the Device Awake

To ensure your Android device continuously monitors your network without going to sleep:

1. Open the Orb app on your Android device
2. Go to account settings by tapping the gear icon in the top right corner
3. Tap "Keep Awake"
4. Tap "Dim Display" if desired, or skip to keep the display on

## Step 4: (Optional) Use Ethernet Instead of WiFi

If you want to monitor your wired network connection instead of WiFi:

1. Connect a USB-C to Ethernet adapter to your Android device
2. Plug an Ethernet cable from your router or network switch into the adapter
3. On your Android device, enable Airplane Mode to disable WiFi
4. The device will automatically use the Ethernet connection for network monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Device Still Goes to Sleep

- Make sure the "Stay Awake" option is enabled in Developer Options
- Ensure the device is connected to a power source
- Try using a "Keep Screen On" app from the Play Store as an alternative

### Can't Find Developer Options

- The location of Developer Options varies by device manufacturer and Android version
- Try searching for "Developer" in the Settings search bar
- On some devices, you may need to tap "Software Information" before finding the Build Number

Congratulations! Your old Android device is now repurposed as a dedicated Orb sensor, continuously monitoring your network health.
