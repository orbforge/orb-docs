# Install the Orb Sensor on macOS

## Installation

Setting up a macOS device as an Orb sensor can be done thanks to Homebrew with a single command:

```bash
brew install orbforge/orb/orb
```

If you don't have Homebrew installed, visit the [Homebrew site](https://brew.sh/) for up-to-date installation instructions. If you would prefer to run the Orb macOS app instead, view our [macOS installation guide](/docs/install-orb/macos.md).

## Usage

To start orbforge/orb/orb immediately and restart at login:

```bash
brew services start orbforge/orb/orb
```

If you don't want/need a background service or would likse to use other CLI functions, you can run:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/orb/bin/orb help
```

for a list of available commands.
