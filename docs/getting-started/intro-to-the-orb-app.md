# Intro to the Orb app

The Orb app is your command center for monitoring and understanding your network's performance. This guide provides a quick tour of the app's interface and main features.

## Main Screens

### Orb Summary

The Orb Summary is the first screen you'll see when opening the app. It provides:

- An overall Orb Score for your network
- Orb name, location, connection type (WiFi, Wired LAN, Cellular), and Internet Service Provider (ISP) information
- Current status of each Orb linked to your account and found on the network (Online, Offline, Connecting)
- Timeframe selector to view performance over different periods of time
- Compare Orb Scores across multiple Orbs linked to your account or found nearby
