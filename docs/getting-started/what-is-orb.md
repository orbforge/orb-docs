# What is Orb?

Orb is an intelligent app &amp; platform designed to help you understand and improve your internet connectivity. Unlike traditional speed tests that provide only a momentary snapshot, Orb continuously monitors your network to give you a complete picture of your true internet experience, beyond just peak speed.

## How Orb Works

Orb works by deploying "sensors" that continuously monitor your network connection. A sensor can be:

1. **The Orb app on your device**: Your phone, tablet, or computer can act as a sensor when the app is running.
2. **A dedicated device**: For continuous monitoring, you can set up a dedicated device (like a Raspberry Pi or a spare phone) that runs as an Orb sensor 24/7. Access the information from this device through any Orb app.

These Orb sensors collect data about your network's performance and send it to the Orb service, which analyzes the information and provides you with insights through the Orb app.

## What Orb Measures

Orb tracks three key aspects of your network performance:

- **Responsiveness**: How quickly your network responds to requests
- **Reliability**: How consistently your connection works without interruptions
- **Speed**: How fast data can be transferred to and from your devices

Together, these metrics provide a comprehensive view of your Internet Experience.

## Orb Scores

Orb measures various metrics grouped into ‚ö°Ô∏èResponsiveness, üíéReliability, and üïïSpeed,
giving each a simple score out of 100, which combine into your overall Orb Score.

## Orb Score Scale

Orb Scores are represented on a 0-100 scale. A score of 90 and above represents a stellar experience; below 70 represents a poor experience.
