# Installing Orb on Windows

This guide will walk you through the process of installing the Orb app on your Windows PC.

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 (64-bit) or Windows 11

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the Orb Installer

1. On your Windows machine, download the Windows app and installer [Windows Installer](https://pkgs.orb.net/stable/windows/orb.appinstaller)
2. Wait for the installer to download completely.

### Step 2: Run the Installer

1. Locate the downloaded file in your Downloads folder.
2. Double-click on the file to run the installer.
   - If you see a warning about an unrecognized app, click "More info" and then "Run anyway."
3. If prompted by User Account Control, click "Yes" to allow the installation.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions in the installer.
5. Click "Finish" when the installation is complete.

:::note
If you are having troubles with the installer, there is an experimental, early access .exe installer available on [the Forge](https://orb.net/the-forge/early-access/orb-beta-for-windows-(.exe)). The .exe installer does not currently include automatic updates.

### Step 3: First Launch

1. The Orb app should launch automatically after installation.
2. If not, you can find it in the Start menu or on your desktop.
3. The app will guide you through the initial setup process.

## Step 4: Onboarding and Permissions

When you open the app for the first time, you will be guided through the onboarding process. This includes a series of information modals and permission requests. We also recommend that you create an Orb account to access all features of the app.

## Troubleshooting

### SmartScreen Warning

If Windows SmartScreen shows a warning:

1. Click "More info".
2. Click "Run anyway".

### Installation Fails

If the installation fails:

1. Check that you have enough free disk space.
2. Temporarily disable your antivirus software and try again.
3. Try downloading the installer again in case the file was corrupted.
