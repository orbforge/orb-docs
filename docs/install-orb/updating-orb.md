## Updating Orb Sensors

### Dedicated Sensors

Most dedicated sensors (Raspberry Pi, Debian/Ubuntu systems, etc.) are configured for automatic updates. To manually update:

#### Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade orb
```

#### Docker

```bash
docker pull orbforge/orb:latest
# Then restart your container
```

### Router Sensors (GL-MT2500, etc.)

Router-based sensors typically update automatically. You can check for updates in the router's web interface:

1. Log in to your router's admin panel
2. Navigate to the Orb plugin or application section
3. Look for an "Update" button or option

## Update Frequency

We recommend keeping automatic updates enabled for all Orb installations. Our typical update schedule is:

- **Critical Updates**: Released as needed for security or major bug fixes
- **Feature Updates**: Released every 2-4 weeks
- **Minor Updates**: Released weekly for small improvements

## Troubleshooting Updates

### Update Fails to Install

If an update fails to install:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Ensure you have enough free storage space
3. Restart your device and try again
4. For dedicated sensors, check system logs for errors

### Version Verification

To verify your current Orb version:

1. Open the Orb app
2. Go to Settings
3. Look for "About" or "Version Information"
