# Installing Orb on Android

This guide will walk you through the process of installing the Orb app on your Android phone or tablet.

## System Requirements

- Android 10 or newer
- Google Play Store installed

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download from Google Play Store

1. Open the Google Play Store on your Android device.
2. Search for "Orb".
3. Tap on the Orb app in the search results.
4. Tap "Install".
5. Wait for the download and installation to complete.

Alternatively, you can use this direct link: [Download Orb on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.orb.orb)

### Step 2: Open the App

1. Once the installation is complete, tap "Open" in the Play Store.
2. Alternatively, find the Orb app icon in your app drawer and tap it.

### Step 3: Onboarding & Permissions

When you first open the app, you'll be presented with several onboarding screens.

1. **Welcome**: Create an account or sign in by tapping "Sign In", or skip to continue.
2. **Location Access**: Location modal to describe the app's use of location data.
3. **Allow Notifications**: Optional but recommended for alerts about network issues.

During the onboarding process, you'll be presented with system prompts intermittently. Choose your preferences for each permission presented.

## Troubleshooting

### App Download Issues

If you're having trouble downloading the app:

1. Check your internet connection.
2. Make sure you have enough free space on your device.
3. Verify that you're signed in to the Play Store with your Google account.
4. Restart your device and try again.

### Permissions Issues

If you need to change permission allowances after installation and setup:

1. Go to Settings > Apps > Orb.
2. Tap Permissions.
3. Enable/disable the necessary permissions.

## Next Steps

Once installed, you'll need to:

[Create an Orb account](/docs/orb-app/creating-an-account.md) if you don't already have one.

Note that for optimal monitoring, we recommend setting up a dedicated sensor that can run continuously, as Android apps have limitations when running in the background.

Configure your Android device as an Orb sensor or [set up a dedicated sensor](/docs/setup-sensor).

For using a spare Android device as a dedicated sensor, see our [Spare Android guide](/docs/setup-sensor/spare-android.md).
