# Deploy & Configure

The Orb platform supports a range of deployment options and is highly configurable. Orb data can be sent to a container in your home, a queue in the cloud, in the fully-managed Orb Cloud, or all of the above. The behavior of each Orb can be modified individually or managed at scale.
