# MDM Deployment

A common use case for Orb Cloud is to install Orb across employee laptops or point of sale systems for an organization. Using Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems simplifies the deployment of the Orb software and linking Orb to your Orb Cloud Space for configuration and data access. Orb currently supports MDM for Windows and macOS.

Walk-through guides are available for:

* [Microsoft Intune](/docs/deploy-and-configure/mdm/intune)
* [Jamf Pro](/docs/deploy-and-configure/mdm/jamf-pro)
* [Mosyle](/docs/deploy-and-configure/mdm/mosyle)

:::info
Orb app versions 1.3 and above are required for MDM support.

There are many MDM solutions, and each supports many paths to accomplishing the same outcome. If your organization uses a different solution, our approach is generic and likely already supports your MDM platform. If you have a preferred way to deploy and configure applications that differs from our guides, we are happy to support you there as well. [Contact us](https://orb.net/contact) and let's figure it out!
